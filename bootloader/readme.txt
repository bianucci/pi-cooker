this is the repo for our rts project at fh ffm in ws 13/14.

plan is to buil a water cooker using the raspberry pi.

users should be able to set a desired water temperature and the pi should control a heating mechansism to heat water till it reaches this temperature.

to heat the water a relais controlled tauchsieder is used.

a display shows current temperature meassured by the pi using an mcp3202 ad converter connected to a pt100 temperature sensor.
